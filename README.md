### Smart Contract
- **Secure Fund Management**: Handles deposits, refund requests, and processing securely.
- **Owner-Managed Refunds**: Only the contract owner can process refund requests.
- **Balance Transparency**: View the contract's available funds for user confidence.

---

## **Technologies Used**

### **Frontend**
- **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
- **Web3.js** and **Ethers.js** for Ethereum blockchain interaction.

---

## **How It Works**

### 1. **Deposit Funds**
   - The contract owner or any user can deposit funds into the smart contract.

### 2. **Refund Request**
   - Users can enter their wallet address and request a refund based on their quiz performance.
   - Refund amounts are calculated as a percentage of the course fee.

### 3. **Refund Processing**
   - The owner reviews and processes refund requests.
   - The contract ensures sufficient funds before approving transfers.

### 4. **Transparency**
   - Users can view the contract balance to ensure accountability.

## Prerequisites

To run, test, and deploy the **L-earnings** DApp, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:

---

#### **1. Node.js**  
   - Download and install Node.js from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).  
   - Verify installation by running:  
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

---

#### **2. Truffle Suite** (for smart contract development and testing)  
   - Install Truffle globally using npm:  
     ```bash
     npm install -g truffle
     ```
   - Verify installation:  
     ```bash
     truffle version
     ```
   - Truffle is used for:  
     - Compiling Solidity contracts.  
     - Deploying contracts to a blockchain network.  
     - Running automated tests.

---

#### **3. Ganache** (Local Ethereum Blockchain for testing)  
   - Download and install Ganache from [Ganache official website](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/).  
   - Alternatively, install it via npm:  
     ```bash
     npm install -g ganache
     ```
   - Ganache simulates a blockchain network, providing accounts preloaded with test ETH for smart contract interactions.

---

#### **4. MetaMask**  
   - Install the MetaMask browser extension for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.  
   - Set up a wallet and connect it to the Ganache network (for local testing) or a testnet.

---

#### **5. Web3.js** (for blockchain interaction in the frontend)  
   - Web3.js is included via a CDN in the project files. Ensure you have internet access when running the application.

---

#### **6. Ethers.js** (optional, for additional blockchain utilities)  
   - Ethers.js is also included via a CDN in the project files.

---

#### **7. Solidity**  
   - Solidity is the smart contract language used in this project. Truffle automatically compiles Solidity code.

---

#### **8. Code Editor**  
   - Use a code editor such as [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for managing project files and writing code.

---

#### **9. Ethereum Wallet with Test ETH**  
   - Use MetaMask to manage your wallet. For testing, you can obtain test ETH from faucets (if using a public test network).

---

#### **10. Testing with Truffle**  
   - Truffle is also used for writing and executing tests for smart contracts.
   - Test the contracts with the following commands:
     ```bash
     truffle test
     ```
   - Ensure all tests pass before deployment.

---

These prerequisites will prepare you for a seamless experience in developing, testing, and deploying the **L-earnings** DApp.

## How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to run the **L-earnings** project locally on your machine:

---

#### **1. Set Up Ganache**  
   Start a local blockchain using Ganache CLI:  
   ```bash
   ganache-cli --port 8545 --networkId 1337
   ```  
   This simulates an Ethereum blockchain locally.

---

#### **2. Open Project Folder**  
   Open the main project folder in your terminal.

---

#### **3. Initialize Truffle**  
   Initialize Truffle in the project directory:  
   ```bash
   truffle init
   ```

---

#### **4. Compile Smart Contracts**  
   Compile the smart contract using Truffle:  
   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```

---

#### **5. Set Up Truffle Configuration**  
   Edit the `truffle-config.js` file to include the local Ganache network configuration. Use the following settings:  
   ```javascript
   networks: {
       development: {
           host: "127.0.0.1", // Localhost
           port: 8545,        // Ganache default port
           network_id: "1337" // Match Ganache's network ID
       }
   }
   ```

---

#### **6. Test the Smart Contract**  
   Run the tests for the smart contract to ensure everything works as expected:  
   ```bash
   truffle test
   ```  
   All tests should pass.

---

#### **7. Deploy the Smart Contract**  
   Deploy the smart contract to the local Ganache blockchain:  
   ```bash
   truffle migrate
   ```  
   Copy the deployed contract's **address** from the terminal.

---

#### **8. Update Refund Page with Contract Details**  
   - **Contract Address:**  
     Paste the contract address from the terminal into the `refund` page's script.  
   - **Contract ABI:**  
     Replace the ABI in the JSON file of the frontend (`refund` page) with the ABI generated by Truffle.

---

#### **9. Set Up MetaMask**  
   - Install the MetaMask browser extension.  
   - Configure MetaMask to connect to the local Ganache network:  
     1. Open MetaMask settings.  
     2. Add a new network with the following details:  
        - **Network Name:** Ganache Local  
        - **New RPC URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8545`  
        - **Chain ID:** 1337  
     3. Import one of the private keys from Ganache into MetaMask.

---

#### **10. Deploy Website Login Page**  
   - Use a local web server to host the project files.  
   - For example, using Python's built-in server:  
     ```bash
     python -m http.server
     ```  
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
